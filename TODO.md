# DONE
- Basic cell structure implementation; linked list, allocation, finding, and adding

# TODO
- modify `get_cell_ll` to give an actual pointer to the cell (currently it copies it... gotta figure out how tho)
- Create game logic (add `ticks` system to `state_t`)
- Terminal interface (help commands, configuration, etc.)


# FUTURE
- Ability to load-save patterns
- Ability to edit the playfield mid-game
