# DONE
- Basic cell structure implementation; linked list, allocation, finding, and adding
- Added tick system, including ability to measure game performance

# TODO
- Create game logic (one thing, make a `find_neighbours()` fn that DOES NOT iteratively locate the neighbours)
- Terminal interface (help commands, configuration, etc.)


# FUTURE
- Ability to load-save patterns
- Ability to edit the playfield mid-game
